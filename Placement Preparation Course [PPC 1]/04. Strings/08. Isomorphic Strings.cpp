/*
Given two strings 'str1' and 'str2', check if these two strings are isomorphic to each other.
Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2 while preserving the order.
Note: All occurrences of every character in ‘str1’ should map to the same character in ‘str2’
